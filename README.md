# Assessing Impacts of Nationwide REDD+ Programs Through Synthetic Controls

Tropical forests serve a number of key roles in the Earth system: regulating CO2 and temperature, providing habitats for a wealth of biodiversity, and stimulating economic activity in several developing nations. Their endangerment has led to the creation of REDD+, a UN framework by which rich countries pay poorer countries to reduce deforestation. 

Current methodologies to evaluate the impact of REDD+ and other nationwide conservation policies are lacking. The goal of this project was to utilise synthetic controls as a robust method of quantifying the impact of such policies, as well as to identify weaknesses in such approaches. 

# Datasets

The primary dataset employed is the Global Forest Change 2001 - 2021 dataset generated by Hansen et al. at a 30-meter spatial resolution globally. The relevant tiles acquired from this were stored on Sherwood, a computing facility available through the Cambridge Center for Carbon Credits (4C). If running time series generation locally, please ensure you have first acquire the correct tiles through Global Forest Change and alter paths to those files appropriately. 

Other smaller datasets used, including covariates (mainly obtained from the World Bank Statistical Database), are included within this repository.

# Assessing Impacts of Nationwide REDD+ Programs Through Synthetic Controls

Tropical forests serve a number of key roles in the Earth system: regulating CO2 and temperature, providing habitats for a wealth of biodiversity, and stimulating economic activity in several developing nations. Their endangerment has led to the creation of REDD+, a UN framework by which rich countries pay poorer countries to reduce deforestation. 

Current methodologies to evaluate the impact of REDD+ and other nationwide conservation policies are lacking. The goal of this project was to utilise synthetic controls as a robust method of quantifying the impact of such policies, as well as to identify weaknesses in such approaches.
